# The replacement has to keep the original's install_name and version fields: the cairo script
# interpreter records both in its load commands, and dyld refuses a library whose compatibility
# version is lower than what the client asked for. Rather than hard-coding them (they change
# whenever Homebrew bumps lzo), read them back off the file we are about to overwrite.
