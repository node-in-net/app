#
# Nothing is overwritten in place: src/gtk-app/setup.nsi excludes libjbig-0.dll from the
# recursive File directive over artifacts/gtk4-win32-x64 and picks ours up instead. That way
# the GPL library is never packed into the installer at all — excluding it matters, because
# shipping it inside the archive would be distribution regardless of which copy wins on disk.
#
# Run anywhere a mingw-w64 cross compiler is available; builder/build.sh exe calls it.
