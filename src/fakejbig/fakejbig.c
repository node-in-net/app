/*
 * Replacement for libjbig in the Windows bundle.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The bundle's only GPL component was libjbig (JBIG-KIT 2.1, by Markus Kuhn; the DLL says
 * "Licence: GPL" in its own strings). Nothing in node.in.net asks for it. It arrives at the
 * end of a chain of hard, load-time imports:
 *
 *     libgtk-4 / libgdk_pixbuf -> libtiff -> libjbig
 *
 * The MSYS2 build of gdk-pixbuf compiles TIFF support in, so libtiff is a load-time
 * dependency, and libtiff in turn imports ten symbols from libjbig. Neither DLL can simply
 * be dropped — the application would fail to start.
 *
 * libtiff calls these ten only for TIFF files whose Compression tag is JBIG (34661). That is
 * one of its fifteen codecs, and effectively nothing produces it: bi-level scans and faxes
 * use CCITT G3/G4, everything else uses LZW, Deflate, PackBits or JPEG. Our own code never
 * asks for TIFF at all — the viewer and the file manager hand bytes to gdk-pixbuf and let it
 * sniff the format.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
 * ---------------------
 * The same chain exists on Linux (libtiff.so.6 -> libjbig.so.0), so it was tested there: an
 * instrumented stand-in logging every call was preloaded ahead of the real library, and eight
 * TIFFs covering raw, LZW, Deflate, PackBits, JPEG and the three CCITT bi-level variants were
 * loaded through gdk-pixbuf. All eight decoded identically to the control run, and not one
 * jbg_* function was called. The CCITT cases matter most: they are the closest neighbours to
 * JBIG's purpose, and if libtiff touched this code for bi-level images it would show there.
 *
 * TRADE-OFF, STATED PLAINLY
 * -------------------------
 * A TIFF that really is JBIG-compressed will fail to open instead of displaying. If that ever
 * matters, the honest fixes in order of preference are: rebuild libtiff with --disable-jbig,
 * so neither library ships; or rebuild gdk-pixbuf without TIFF support, which drops the whole
 * branch. Both are MSYS2 package rebuilds.
 *
 * The built file keeps the name libjbig-0.dll because libtiff records that name in its import
 * table; assets/licenses/BUNDLED-COMPONENTS.txt says what it actually is.
 *
 * No JBIG-KIT code was used or consulted. Only the function signatures are shared, taken from
 * the public jbig.h interface; signatures are not copyrightable.
